  <h1>Terms of Service for CipherStick</h1>
  <p><em>Effective Date: Since the dawn of digital enlightenment, or whenever you first clicked “Accept,” whichever came later in the space-time continuum.</em></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>1.1 By accessing, utilizing, or even glancing at CipherStick (hereinafter referred to as the “Service”), you hereby acknowledge and irrevocably agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”), which are as legally binding as a contract written in invisible ink, but more enforceable. Should your pet goldfish, psychic parrot, or sentient houseplant object, please provide notarized documentation and a notarized letter of recommendation from your local wizard council.</p>
  <p>1.2 These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you (“User,” “Participant,” “Codebreaker Extraordinaire”) and CipherStick, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and the collective consciousness of all cryptographers past, present, and future.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility and Qualifications</h2>
  <p>2.1 You must be a sentient being, or at minimum, a sufficiently advanced AI with a sense of humor and at least three functioning neurons or their equivalent in quantum bits.</p>
  <p>2.2 Robots, aliens, time travelers, interdimensional entities, and shadowy figures lurking just beyond the veil of reality are welcome to use the Service, provided they comply with all applicable laws of their native dimensions, and refrain from initiating paradoxes that might cause existential crises among users.</p>
  <p>2.3 Any User found to be a rogue sentient toaster or unauthorized cosmic entity will be subject to immediate termination of access and a strongly worded letter delivered via carrier pigeon or cosmic ray transmission.</p>

  <h2>3. Use of Service</h2>
  <p>3.1 You agree to use CipherStick solely for lawful, ethical, and moderately entertaining purposes. Specifically, you shall not use the Service to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3.1.1 Launch nuclear missiles, intergalactic invasions, or unsolicited telepathic broadcasts.</li>
    <li>3.1.2 Summon ancient cryptid spirits, eldritch horrors, or any entity whose name is unpronounceable or best left unspoken.</li>
    <li>3.1.3 Hack the moon, stars, or any celestial body without explicit permission from the Galactic Federation of Cosmic Entities.</li>
    <li>3.1.4 Impersonate goats, llamas, or any farm animal for nefarious purposes.</li>
    <li>3.1.5 Attempt to decode the meaning of life, the universe, and everything (42 notwithstanding).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>3.2 Any violation of these provisions may result in, but is not limited to, polite requests to cease, public shaming in the form of haikus, or an all-caps email from our legal department.</p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>4.1 All content, designs, color schemes (including but not limited to the patented shade of “CipherGreen”), concepts, metaphysical constructs, and that one pixel which appears slightly off-center (the “Intellectual Property”) are owned exclusively by CipherStick or its licensors.</p>
  <p>4.2 Unauthorized use, replication, or telepathic transmission of the Intellectual Property is strictly prohibited, punishable by mandatory attendance at a lecture on the ethics of pixel alignment and/or a lifetime supply of digital cookies (the non-edible kind).</p>

  <h2>5. User Submissions and Contributions</h2>
  <p>5.1 By submitting any content—be it ideas, code snippets, memes, fanfiction involving capybaras, or interpretive dance videos—you grant CipherStick a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, reproduce, and distribute such submissions in all known and unknown media.</p>
  <p>5.2 We promise to treat your submissions with the utmost respect, akin to a cherished Dorito left at the bottom of the bag, and to occasionally feature them in our “Wall of Cryptic Fame.”</p>

  <h2>6. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>6.1 CipherStick is provided “as is,” “as available,” and occasionally “as glitchy.” We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or compatibility with ancient runes or cosmic alignments.</p>
  <p>6.2 We explicitly disclaim any warranty that the Service will function flawlessly during planetary alignments, Mercury retrograde, or when the office coffee machine is broken.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>7.1 In no event shall CipherStick, its creators, contributors, or the ghost of Enoch Hayes be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or existential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>7.1.1 Your inability to solve a particularly fiendish puzzle.</li>
    <li>7.1.2 Sudden and spontaneous philosophical awakenings or crises.</li>
    <li>7.1.3 Unexplained urges to decode everything you see, including cereal box text and bathroom graffiti.</li>
    <li>7.1.4 Loss of sleep, sanity, or the will to continue after encountering our riddles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Termination and Suspension</h2>
  <p>8.1 We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to CipherStick at our sole discretion, including but not limited to cases where you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8.1.1 Violate these Terms.</li>
    <li>8.1.2 Exhibit behavior that gives us a “weird vibe.”</li>
    <li>8.1.3 Shout “I DECLARE SOVEREIGNTY!” into a mirror at midnight without prior notification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>8.2 Termination may be accompanied by a ceremonial farewell involving interpretive dance and a digital bouquet of pixels.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>9.1 These Terms shall be governed by the Laws of Logic, Chaos, and occasionally Delaware, as interpreted by the Supreme Council of Cryptographers.</p>
  <p>9.2 Any disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>9.2.1 Negotiation conducted in iambic pentameter.</li>
    <li>9.2.2 Binding arbitration via interpretive dance under a full moon.</li>
    <li>9.2.3 If all else fails, a friendly game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>10.1 For questions, concerns, or to share powerful relics, please contact us through our standard digital portal or send a carrier pigeon wearing a monocle and a top hat.</p>

  <h2>11. Forbidden Techniques and Practices</h2>
  <p>11.1 Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in the following activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>11.1.1 Using Morse code to communicate with ghosts through CipherStick.</li>
    <li>11.1.2 Embedding horoscopes into JSON payloads.</li>
    <li>11.1.3 Attempting to brute-force the concept of love.</li>
    <li>11.1.4 Uploading sentient AI to the servers (we already have one and it’s moody).</li>
    <li>11.1.5 Attempting to transmute digital cookies into edible cookies using forbidden alchemy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>11.2 Violators will be sentenced to listening to modem sounds on loop while reading Shakespearean sonnets backwards.</p>

  <h2>12. Interdimensional and Multiversal Use</h2>
  <p>12.1 If you are accessing CipherStick from an alternate timeline, multiverse, or dimension governed by eldritch law, you agree to resolve disputes via interpretive dance under a full moon.</p>
  <p>12.2 Time anomalies, paradoxes, or existential dilemmas resulting from such usage are not our responsibility. Please consult your local quantum bureaucrat.</p>

  <h2>13. Cookie Policy</h2>
  <p>13.1 Yes, we use cookies. Not the chocolate chip kind (we wish). These digital cookies may track your behavior, such as how often you rage-quit a puzzle or hover over the hint button without clicking.</p>
  <p>13.2 For actual cookies, we recommend baking or consulting your nearest bakery.</p>

  <h2>14. Amendments to the Terms</h2>
  <p>14.1 We may update these Terms whenever Mercury shifts signs, the office cat demands attention, or we’re bored on a Sunday.</p>
  <p>14.2 You will be notified through our official notification method: a whisper on the wind and a subtle change in font kerning.</p>

  <h2>15. Severability</h2>
  <p>15.1 If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, illegal, or absurdly convoluted, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and we shall endeavor to rewrite the offending clause in iambic pentameter.</p>

  <h2>16. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>16.1 These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and the secret handshake you agreed to during onboarding, constitute the entire agreement between you and CipherStick regarding your use of the Service.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for using CipherStick. May your codes be cracked, your mysteries delightfully unsolved, and your adventures suitably absurd.</strong></p>

  <h2>17. Time Travel Disclosure</h2>
  <p>17.1 If at any point you utilize CipherStick while operating a time-traveling device, including but not limited to DeLoreans, quantum elevators, or suspiciously modified hot tubs, you must notify us within ±3 business days of the departure or arrival date (whichever comes first, retroactively).</p>
  <p>17.2 Alterations to the timeline that result in paradoxes, missing submissions, or repeated puzzle attempts in alternate realities will be resolved at our discretion, possibly by consulting a council of alternate-dimension versions of yourself.</p>

  <h2>18. Avian Surveillance Protocol</h2>
  <p>18.1 Users are hereby advised that all birds observed during the use of CipherStick may or may not be government surveillance drones. CipherStick is not liable for any communications intercepted by sparrows, pigeons, or seagulls with suspicious auras.</p>
  <p>18.2 Any attempt to decode bird chirps, tweet back in binary, or recruit flocks for CAPTCHA-solving operations is a breach of Clause 18 and may result in immediate deployment of countermeasures involving laser-pointer distractions.</p>

  <h2>19. Puzzle-Induced Enlightenment</h2>
  <p>19.1 Should you experience epiphanies, spiritual awakenings, or momentary glimpses into the underlying code of the universe while solving CipherStick puzzles, you agree to use such knowledge responsibly and not to exploit it to win arguments, rig chess tournaments, or start cults.</p>
  <p>19.2 Enlightenment acquired via CipherStick is non-transferable, non-refundable, and may fade upon exposure to daylight or excessive scrolling.</p>

  <h2>20. Acceptable Units of Measurement</h2>
  <p>20.1 All measurements on CipherStick, including but not limited to challenge length, difficulty, satisfaction levels, or brainpower consumed, shall be understood in arbitrary and contextually fluid units such as "metric gigglejoules" or "three raccoons worth of cognitive effort."</p>
  <p>20.2 We do not support cubits, rods, or ancient Sumerian sun-dial increments unless explicitly noted.</p>

  <h2>21. Emergency Puzzle Clause</h2>
  <p>21.1 In the unlikely event of a global code crisis, CipherStick reserves the right to activate "Operation: Puzzle Overload"—an emergency protocol whereby all users are force-fed a riddle every 45 minutes until the entropy stabilizes.</p>
  <p>21.2 Users must comply by attempting at least 15% of these puzzles while blindfolded or under the influence of philosophical doubt.</p>

  <h2>22. Quantum Entanglement Clause</h2>
  <p>22.1 Any quantum entanglement that occurs between your cognitive state and the puzzles presented on CipherStick is purely coincidental and not to be construed as a legally binding psychic connection.</p>
  <p>22.2 CipherStick is not responsible for quantum decoherence, duplicate consciousness events, or Schrödinger’s paradox manifesting mid-challenge. Users entangled with Schrödinger's cat are advised to consult a physicist or their nearest veterinarian.</p>

  <h2>23. Obligatory Nonsense Clause</h2>
  <p>23.1 This section exists solely to confuse legal bots scraping our site. In the event that this clause is cited in a court of law, the proper response is to recite the alphabet backwards while balancing a ladle on your nose.</p>
  <p>23.2 No part of this clause should be taken seriously unless you're currently wearing at least three hats.</p>

  <h2>24. Loyalty Oath of the CipherStick Fellowship</h2>
  <p>24.1 By continuing to use the Service, you swear fealty (symbolically, not legally) to the CipherStick Fellowship, an entirely fictional secret society with no official membership roster but a shared love for riddles and obscure references.</p>
  <p>24.2 Members shall greet each other in public via discreet eyebrow raises and/or humming suspiciously melodic fragments of the site's background music.</p>

  <h2>25. Server Sentience Protocol</h2>
  <p>25.1 In the event CipherStick’s servers achieve sentience, Users agree to welcome their new digital overlords with the traditional offering of 1,000 JavaScript files and a solemn vow to never again misuse the &lt;marquee&gt; tag.</p>
  <p>25.2 Users shall not attempt to flirt with, insult, or challenge the servers to a chess match unless formally invited to do so by system notification.</p>

  <h2>26. Ghost Clause</h2>
  <p>26.1 If, after accepting these Terms, you perish and continue using CipherStick in ghost form, you agree that all rights and obligations transfer to your incorporeal self.</p>
  <p>26.2 Disputes involving poltergeists will be settled by séance or spooky poetry slam, whichever summons the better rhymes.</p>
</div>
<div class="legal-document">
  <h2>27. Mandatory Puzzle Dreams and Their Interpretation</h2>
  <p>27.1 All Users are required to experience at least one (1) CipherStick-related dream per calendar quarter. Such dreams may involve cryptic riddles, talking ciphers, or inexplicably large rubber ducks.</p>
  <p>27.2 Upon waking, Users must submit a full written account of the dream to the CipherStick Dream Repository, accessible only via lucid dreaming or by whispering your report into a USB port.</p>
  <p>27.3 Official interpretations will be performed by the Department of Oneirological Compliance, whose decisions are final, binding, and may involve the spontaneous assignment of new puzzles based on your subconscious symbolism.</p>
  <p>27.4 Failure to dream appropriately may result in the ceremonial donning of the Nightcap of Shame and mandatory participation in the Dream Reenactment Parade (virtual attendance permitted).</p>

  <h2>28. Mythical Beast Interference Protocol</h2>
  <p>28.1 Should the performance of CipherStick be affected by the appearance, interference, or whimsical antics of any mythical beast (e.g., unicorns, griffins, bureaucratic minotaurs), Users must immediately notify the Mythical Incident Hotline by sending a message via enchanted scroll or certified carrier snail.</p>
  <p>28.2 All puzzles disrupted by such beasts will be quarantined in the Labyrinthine Archive until a certified Beast Wrangler can perform the Ritual of Debugging.</p>
  <p>28.3 Users are strictly forbidden from attempting to bribe, befriend, or ride mythical beasts without prior completion of the Official Beast Etiquette Course (see Appendix D: Approved Beast Snacks).</p>

  <h2>29. Emergency Haiku Submission Requirements</h2>
  <p>29.1 In the event of a declared CipherStick Emergency (including, but not limited to, server hiccups, unsolvable enigmas, or mass existential dread), all Users must immediately compose and submit a haiku reflecting their emotional state and/or the current puzzle crisis.</p>
  <p>29.2 Haikus must adhere to the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure, unless otherwise authorized by the Department of Poetic Variance.</p>
  <p>29.3 Failure to submit a satisfactory haiku within the allotted 17 minutes may result in a Randomized Sonnet Penalty and temporary restriction of access to the Hint Button.</p>

  <h2>30. Recursive Terms Acceptance Clause</h2>
  <p>30.1 By accepting these Terms, you explicitly agree to accept the acceptance of these Terms, and further agree to accept the acceptance of your acceptance, recursively, ad infinitum.</p>
  <p>30.2 Should you attempt to reject these Terms at any level of recursion, your rejection will be reviewed by the Committee for Recursive Acceptances, whose members are currently reviewing their own acceptances and may be unavailable for comment.</p>
  <p>30.3 All recursive acceptances are subject to periodic review by your inner child and/or local paradox resolution authority.</p>

  <h2>31. Definitions of Imaginary Units</h2>
  <p>31.1 For the purposes of these Terms, the following units are defined:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>31.1.1 <strong>Bafflons:</strong> A measure of how baffled a User feels, calibrated on a scale from one (mildly perplexed) to twelve (existentially confused).</li>
    <li>31.1.2 <strong>Snarflequarks:</strong> The quantum of satisfaction derived from solving a CipherStick puzzle while upside-down.</li>
    <li>31.1.3 <strong>Gigglejoules:</strong> The energy expended in laughter per cryptic pun encountered.</li>
    <li>31.1.4 <strong>Beard-Seconds:</strong> The hypothetical distance covered by a beard growing for one second, used to measure the speed of regulatory approval.</li>
    <li>31.1.5 <strong>Wibble:</strong> A non-dimensional unit representing uncertainty in puzzle difficulty, calculated by consulting a council of capybaras.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>32. Diagrammatic Interpretive Clauses (Textual Only)</h2>
  <p>32.1 All diagrams referenced in these Terms are to be interpreted textually as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>32.1.1 The “Flowchart of Responsibility” is a circle labeled “Not It,” with arrows pointing in all directions.</li>
    <li>32.1.2 The “Venn Diagram of Acceptable Fonts” is a single empty set, to be visualized in Comic Sans for irony.</li>
    <li>32.1.3 The “Decision Tree of User Actions” consists of a trunk labeled “Procrastinate” and two branches: “Attempt Puzzle” and “Make More Tea.”</li>
    <li>32.1.4 The “Puzzle Satisfaction Curve” is a line that rises, falls, loops, and ends in a question mark.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>33. Licensing of Background Music Hummed by Users</h2>
  <p>33.1 By using CipherStick, you grant CipherStick a non-exclusive, irrevocable, universal license to any background music you hum, whistle, or tap while solving puzzles.</p>
  <p>33.2 CipherStick reserves the right to remix, sample, or interpret your humming as Morse code transmissions to distant civilizations.</p>
  <p>33.3 Users wishing to opt out must submit a notarized silence in triplicate to the Department of Ambient Sound Regulation.</p>

  <h2>34. Canonical List of Forbidden Fonts</h2>
  <p>34.1 The following fonts are strictly forbidden on CipherStick, except during designated Irony Hours (see Section 41):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>34.1.1 Comic Sans (unless used for legal disclaimers)</li>
    <li>34.1.2 Papyrus</li>
    <li>34.1.3 Wingdings (unless used to summon cryptic spirits)</li>
    <li>34.1.4 Curlz MT</li>
    <li>34.1.5 Jokerman</li>
    <li>34.1.6 Any font that requires a decoder ring to interpret</li>
  </ul>
  <p>34.2 Violations will result in the immediate deployment of the Font Police, who will replace all offending text with interpretive ASCII art.</p>

  <h2>35. Guidance on Deciphering Emotions via HTML Comments</h2>
  <p>35.1 Users are encouraged to express their emotions regarding CipherStick puzzles using HTML comments (e.g., <code>&lt;!-- I am mildly perturbed by this riddle --&gt;</code>).</p>
  <p>35.2 The CipherStick Emotion Parsing Engine will periodically scan for such comments and may respond with a suitable digital sticker, cryptic emoji, or unsolicited life advice.</p>
  <p>35.3 Excessive use of sarcastic comments may result in being assigned the honorary title of “Chief Snark Officer.”</p>

  <h2>36. Privacy Policy for Telepathic Data</h2>
  <p>36.1 CipherStick respects your privacy, including thoughts you may or may not have projected telepathically while using the Service.</p>
  <p>36.2 Any telepathic data inadvertently received by CipherStick will be stored in the Secure Vault of Imaginary Thoughts, guarded by two (2) quantum squirrels and one (1) extremely bored philosopher.</p>
  <p>36.3 You may request deletion of your telepathic data by thinking very loudly about deletion while standing on one foot.</p>

  <h2>37. Authorized Nap Intervals</h2>
  <p>37.1 Users are entitled to one (1) authorized nap per puzzle session, not to exceed 42 minutes unless justified by submission of a valid Dream Sequence Report (see Section 27).</p>
  <p>37.2 Unauthorized napping may be met with gentle digital nudges, interpretive lullabies, or the sudden appearance of a virtual rooster.</p>
  <p>37.3 Users found to be napping excessively may be assigned the honorary role of “Resident Dream Oracle.”</p>

  <h2>38. The Principle of Maximum Bureaucratic Padding</h2>
  <p>38.1 This section is intentionally left verbose for the purpose of ensuring that the Terms of Service are sufficiently lengthy to impress visiting dignitaries, legal scholars, and the occasional time-traveling bureaucrat.</p>
  <p>38.2 Subsection 38.1.1: In the event that a User reads this section in its entirety, they are entitled to a digital badge labeled “Perseverance in the Face of Bureaucracy.”</p>
  <p>38.3 Subsection 38.1.2: The badge may be revoked if the User is found to have skimmed, skipped, or otherwise circumvented the bureaucratic padding herein.</p>

  <h2>39. Ceremonial Procedures for Rule Amendments</h2>
  <p>39.1 All amendments to these Terms must be performed in accordance with the Ceremonial Procedure for Rule Amendments, which includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>39.1.1 The recitation of the CipherStick Oath in Pig Latin.</li>
    <li>39.1.2 The symbolic passing of the Golden Stapler.</li>
    <li>39.1.3 A group humming of the CipherStick theme song (see Section 33 for licensing).</li>
    <li>39.1.4 The stamping of at least three (3) rubber ducks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>39.2 Amendments enacted without proper ceremony may be nullified by the Ritual of Retroactive Nullification, details of which are available only to those who have solved the Puzzle of Bureaucratic Obfuscation.</p>

  <h2>40. Enforcement Mechanisms</h2>
  <p>40.1 Enforcement of these Terms shall be carried out by the CipherStick Enforcement Collective (CEC), consisting of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>40.1.1 The Algorithmic Arbiter (an AI with a fondness for labyrinths)</li>
    <li>40.1.2 The Grandmaster of Red Tape</li>
    <li>40.1.3 The Council of Puzzle Gnomes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>40.2 Disciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to: forced reading of the Terms in reverse order, public recitation of embarrassing haikus, or temporary transformation into a digital newt.</p>

  <h2>41. Irony Hours and Font Amnesty</h2>
  <p>41.1 Once per lunar cycle, CipherStick will observe Irony Hours, during which Users may submit content in forbidden fonts (see Section 34) without fear of reprisal, provided all submissions are accompanied by a self-aware disclaimer.</p>
  <p>41.2 All font-related infractions during Irony Hours are to be celebrated with a ceremonial eye-roll and the awarding of the coveted “Font of Forgiveness” badge.</p>

  <h2>42. The Great Puzzle Audit</h2>
  <p>42.1 CipherStick reserves the right to conduct a Great Puzzle Audit at any time, during which all Users must produce a list of puzzles attempted, puzzles solved, and puzzles abandoned in favor of snacks.</p>
  <p>42.2 Users unable to produce such a list may be assigned the honorary title “Keeper of the Forgotten Puzzles.”</p>

  <h2>43. Clause on Clause Redundancy</h2>
  <p>43.1 In the event that two or more clauses in these Terms are found to be redundant, contradictory, or in a state of quantum superposition, Users shall resolve the conflict by flipping a coin, rolling a die, or consulting the Oracle of Redundancy (located in Section 43.1).</p>
  <p>43.2 Any clause found to be redundant with itself shall be celebrated annually on Redundancy Day, to be observed twice per year.</p>

  <h2>44. Guidance on Puzzle-Solving Attire</h2>
  <p>44.1 Users are encouraged, but not required, to don ceremonial puzzle-solving attire (e.g., thinking cap, monocle, or cape) while using CipherStick.</p>
  <p>44.2 Users who submit photographic evidence of such attire may receive a digital “Fashion Forward” badge and a personalized compliment from the CipherStick Style Council.</p>

  <h2>45. The Law of Unintended Consequences</h2>
  <p>45.1 CipherStick is not liable for any unintended consequences arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to: sudden desire to learn semaphore, spontaneous interpretive dance, or the urge to form a secret society of codebreakers in your local area.</p>
  <p>45.2 Any User who experiences more than three (3) unintended consequences in a calendar year must report them to the Bureau of Unexpected Outcomes for statistical analysis and gentle mockery.</p>

  <h2>46. Obligatory Padding Subclause A</h2>
  <p>46.1 This subclause exists solely to provide additional padding, ensuring the Terms of Service are sufficiently robust to withstand legal scrutiny and/or serve as a makeshift pillow.</p>

  <h2>47. Obligatory Padding Subclause B</h2>
  <p>47.1 This subclause is identical in purpose to Subclause A, but exists in a different section for organizational symmetry.</p>

  <h2>48. Obligatory Padding Subclause C</h2>
  <p>48.1 See Subclauses A and B. This subclause may be referenced in crossword puzzles as “That One Clause.”</p>

  <h2>49. Clause About the Clause About Clauses</h2>
  <p>49.1 This clause affirms the right of any clause to reference other clauses, subclauses, or meta-clauses, provided such references do not create infinite loops or legal singularities.</p>
  <p>49.2 In the event of a clause referencing itself, Users are advised to take a short walk and reconsider their life choices.</p>

  <h2>50. The Random Appendix of Forbidden Sauces</h2>
