# The Vision: ShortcutStudio

ShortcutStudio is the premier AI-powered platform for building Apple Shortcuts. Our goal is to democratize automation by turning natural language into powerful, functional, and safe `.shortcut` files.

## Core Pillars
1.  **Magic Experience**: The user types a thought, and a shortcut appears. The process should feel instantaneous and magical, visualized by our "Live Build" streaming interface.
2.  **Premium Quality**: We are not just a tool; we are a crafted experience. The UI is sleek, dark-moded, and animation-rich (glassmorphism, smooth transitions).
3.  **Safety & Reliability**: Generated shortcuts must be safe to run. Our backend enforces rate limits, sanitizes outputs, and uses a multi-pass AI architecture to ensure correctness.
4.  **Community**: A marketplace for sharing and discovering shortcuts, fostering a community of automation enthusiasts.

## Architecture
-   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS (no build step overhead) for maximum control and performance. Hosted on static hosting.
-   **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (`secrets`) for high-performance, low-latency AI orchestration.
-   **AI**: OpenRouter (GPT-4o/Claude 3.5) for intelligence, with a custom "universal conversion" library to generate valid PLIST XML.

## Changelog
